## Estimate ATEs
# Now let’s work on estimating a demand curve for cigarettes. Specifically, we’re going to estimate the price elasticity of demand for cigarettes. When explaining your findings, try to limit your discussion just to a couple of sentences.

#6. Focusing only on the time period from 1970 to 1990, regress log sales on log prices to estimate the price elasticity of demand over that period. Interpret your results.
# Subset the data for the time period from 1970 to 1990
subset_data <- final.data %>%
  filter(Year >= 1970 & Year <= 1990)

# Perform the regression analysis
model <- lm(log(sales_per_capita) ~ log(price_cpi), data = subset_data)

# Extract the coefficient of the log price variable
price_elasticity <- coef(model)[2]


#7. Again limiting to 1970 to 1990, regress log sales on log prices using the total (federal and state) cigarette tax (in dollars) as an instrument for log prices. Interpret your results and compare your estimates to those without an instrument. Are they different? If so, why?
ivs <- feols(log(sales_per_capita) ~ 1 | log(price_cpi) ~ log(tax_dollar), 
             data=subset_data)

step1 <- lm(log(price_cpi) ~ log(tax_dollar), data=subset_data)
pricehat <- predict(step1)
step2 <- lm(log(sales_per_capita) ~ pricehat, data=subset_data)

#9. Repeat questions 6-7 focusing on the period from 1991 to 2015.
